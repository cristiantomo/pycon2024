# Pycon2024

This repository is dedicated to PyCon Colombia 2024 by Cristian Torres Montenegro, supporting the talk titled "Agent-based Modeling for Artificial Dataset Generation."

To set up the required libraries, install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

The distributions folder houses the results obtained from the generate_variable_distributions notebook.

The example showcased in this repository is based on the KDD 99 Cup dataset (https://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html).

Validation of agent-based modeling is conducted using an ML classifier.
